# MIPS Data Path Simulator

Team: Mikhail Beresnev, Jared Balance, Kevin Hernandez 

Overview: We are looking to code a graphical representation of a processor with data paths highlighted as they are executed. The coding language for this project is to be C++. The project will be split into 4 main focuses/phases: research/planning, text-based functionality, visualization, and a stretch goal of an assembler.  

Research/Planning:  

- Research how each block in the processor works individually, and make a detailed diagram with expected inputs/outputs of each block. 

- Research how to make graphical objects in C++. 

Text Based Functionality: 

- Code and test each of the blocks in the diagram. 

- Combine the blocks together to form the processor. 

- Test the combined functionality, printing the data paths into a text file as a specified instruction goes through the processor. 

Visualization: 

- Create a visualized version of the text-based result, highlighting the data paths used by the processor for an instruction. 

Assembler (Stretch Goal): 

- Build an assembler which would accept MIPs instructions and decode them into binary instructions for the simulator to use. 
 

# Project Roles: 

Mikhail Beresnev: 

Research/Planning: 

- Research into visualization 

- Processor Blocks: Shift left 2, ALU Add, ALU, ALU control 

- Construct detailed processor data path diagram compiled from research into processor blocks
